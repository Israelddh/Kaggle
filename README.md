# Kaggle Dataset Explorations

This repository showcases a collection of exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, and visualization projects based on datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Each subfolder contains a self-contained analysis focused on extracting insights and building practical skills in data science.

The goal is to explore diverse real-world datasets using R, applying techniques such as:

- Data cleaning and wrangling
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Clustering and classification
- Data visualization
- Domain-specific interpretation

These projects serve both as a learning path and a professional portfolio for data science and bioinformatics roles.

## Structure

Each folder within this repository corresponds to an individual dataset and includes:

- A `README.md` describing the objectives and methods
- The dataset used (`.csv` or `.json`)
- The main analysis script(s), usually in R (`.R`)

## Completed Analyses

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [software-analysis](./software-analysis) | Analysis of Amazon Best Sellers in the Software category: pricing trends, reviews, and clustering of products across countries |

## Technologies Used

- R (tidyverse, ggplot2, cluster, etc.)
- Git & GitHub
- Kaggle datasets
